# Python Adventure Game



        This game is somewhat similar to the game WOW.
        You have your Good Guy (the player) and the 
        enemies(automated). Of course you have the infamous 
        Super Bad guy that has way more strenght then the
        rest of the bunch. 
        
### Playing the Game
        When the game is started the player is promted on
        which enemy he would want to attack and in what form
        he would like to attack them. They have options of
        regular attacks or magic attacks. The players and 
        enemies health/magic bars will be at the top to 
        assure that you(the user) can see how you are doing 
        on health in the event you would want to use magic to
        restore your health.
        
*This is a toy command line game that was created on a  basic level to just practice and reienforce skills that I have learned in python language.*
*Things I would change to make better would be to allow more user input as far as naming for the players and enemies and also more attack/magic options*

>Disclosure: This game was created through the assistance of a tutorial.
